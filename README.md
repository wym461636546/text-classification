1:	Run the code in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. 

2:	Ensure that all required modules are installed in your system before running the code. 
	The following modules should be installed: 
		os
		requests
		nltk
		pandas
		numpy
		re
		string
		random
		sklearn
		collections
		xgboost
		mlxtend
		matplotlib
		wordcloud
		multidict

	If you plan to run the BERT model, also install 
		transformers
		torch
		tqdm

3:	Run the code in sequential order, particularly the sections leading up to the dataset split into training and testing. 

4:	Optionally skip certain code chunks, such as wordcloud and frequency distribution charts, or inspecting the structure of selected data and models that are not of interest to you.
